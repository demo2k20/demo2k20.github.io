        <h1>Hitler Fan Fiction</h1>

        <h2>Author: FeedingWizard123</h2>

        <p>Today, I woke up feeling something special, like someone is waiting for me, like I need to fulfill someone's expectation, which is a sensation I never felt before, although, I didn't try to put a lot of thought into it. I skipped school so I can go to the gym, while it's not full of people, since most of them are studying or working before 1 PM. This day is a little different though. Usually, when I arrive, there are still about 3 or 4 people; however, right now the whole gym is empty and not even the cashier girl is around. After a lonely workout, I decide to leave, because I'm thirsty and ran out of water. Basically anything could satisfy my thirst right now. Just about to open the door to the locker room, when I hear someone inside, yelling in german. Thoughts rush through my head, as I realize that I've heard his voice before, but I just can't seem to know where. I open the door. He is right there. My whole body is becoming numb.</p>

        <p>It's him, the F端hrer himself, my beloved leader that I've learned so much about. He stops yelling and looks at me in a way, that I instantly know that he wants me to satisfy his lust. I want him to make the first move, so I just close the door behind us and wait. I'm glad that I can't really speak German, as now I have an excuse for skipping the talking part altogether and doing what I'm here for immediately. He walks towards me with confidence, forcefully pushes me against the door and we start making out. He runs his right hand up on my neck, until he grabs my hair and makes me get on my knees. I don't even have enough time to look up and tell him, that I'll do anything for my F端hrer, before he thrusts his throbbing Panzerkampfwagen inside my mouth. He moves it in and out so viciously, that it makes me wonder what he would be capable of if he had 2 balls instead of just 1. After a while I'm read to receive his aryan seeds.</p>

        <p>I wasn't disappointed, as his single ball did some outstanding work. At this point, everything is covered in semen and blood in a two meter radius. He looks at me, like he feels some sort of regret or guilty; probably, because even he didn't expect the ruthless brutality, that we both witnessed. He looks at me worried and starts to mumble, until I stop him, and say: Sir, it's fine, you did nothing wrong. I was lying on the floor when he left. He smiled at me before he closed the door. I never saw him again and I'm in search of a similar dominant, aryan and soothing gentleman ever since.</p>

        <p class="tab">"studying history is so bullshit, in every single book they make it so its like hitler did wrong things, but in reality, the f端hrer did nothing wrong" adds our lord and saviour, <em>dead</em> at 01.28.2018.</p>
        <p class="tab">Truly mind-boggling claim that was. Such a powerful quote, it makes you think. What the author presumed here is that Hitler/the F端hrer never did anything wrong --- Such a shocker; how can human beings assert dominance with such creativity and dexterity? It drives me insane just to think about this.</p>
