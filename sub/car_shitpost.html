        <h1>Offer of a Lifetime</h1>

        <h2>Author: MC Shaco</h2>

        <p>Hello guys, my name is PÃ©ter Orliczki. I have come to you to deliver an offer of a lifetime, as I am thinking of selling my car more and more as of recently. Lets talk about the details: I can positively say, that both the previous owner of this car, and me, were using and maintaining the car on the same standards. Meaning that it was absolutely trashed around, I mean if there is a hell for cars, this is probably it. I bought this motherfucker and refilled it, only to discover that the fuel tank had a hole in it, leaving a puddle of diesel as a gift everywhere i parked. Let's not even talk about the rust that will inevitably eat away the car. I mean it's treated, for now. The rust is coming. Under my ownership, you best believe the engine was ran to shit, it's a true miracle this thing still runs. The car was safely stored in the streets of Miskolc, and to quote one of the repairman working on the car: "I never have once seen anything like this, there was a big fucking burned rat the size of a cat stuck under the fuel tank." Nowadays, the car is stored in an apartment garage, and from the pipes above some toxic brown shit is dripping down on it even as we speak. I recommend this car to anyone that wants to enjoy a faster car for dirt cheap, provided you get lucky and won't need to pay for an engine rebuild before you eventually realize you would rather want a more reliable option, where you won't be suddenly surprised on the highway that the car is slowing down and can only hit about 70kmph, and that the 3rd gear doesn't work anymore for some still unknown reason. Hit me up if you have what it takes. The rust is coming.</p>
