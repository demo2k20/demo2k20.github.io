        <h1>Dafren's Hypothesis About Goth GF</h1>

        <h2>Author: Dafren</h2>

        <p>It's 2053, I'm on my deathbed suffering from cancer from the radiation poisoning that happend during the nuclear bombing of Nyíregyháza during World War 4. I can see a faint figure in front of me asking me to go with him. I have one last final question before I pass on: "Is goth gf just a myth?" I hear the disappointing answer in which the shadowy form says negative, it is indeed just a myth. Tears start rolling down my face and I'm sad, seconds later I pass on after knowing the secret of the universe.</p>
