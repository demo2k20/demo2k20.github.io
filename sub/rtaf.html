        <h1>Roland's Theorem About Flirting</h1>

        <h2>Author: Me</h2>

        <p>You ever just let the woman talk, and they say something mildly controversial, and your brain just comes up with the perfect cheesy line to reply with, and you just sit there debating whether to say it or not?</p>

        <p>The debating that occurs is directly correlated to Roland's Theorem About Flirting (RTAF for short):</p>

        <p class="tab">- If you decide not to say it, then you automatically lose for not even trying (L)</p>

        <p class="tab">- If you do decide to say it, and you say it before knowing her well enough, she might get weirded out => you get ghosted (L)</p>

        <p class="tab">- If you do decide to say it, and you say it too late, she will have already been picked up by another guy who said it before you did (L)</p>

        <p>RTAF references this specific conundrum as the "Triple L" outcome. As RTAF was developed with time, and as the main hypothesis of it matured, it has been concluded that this specific situation occurs when the person having an RTAF moment is about to take a massive L (extensively researched and tested by Dr. Roland PhD in Internet Retardation, Source: trust me bro). If you ever find yourself in an RTAF internal debate situation, immediately proceed to stop thinking, as it is the most effective way of creating a chance for one to dodge the humongous L that is waiting for the beholder at the gates of hell.</p>
