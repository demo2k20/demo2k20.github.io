        <h1>Welcome to Demo's Shitposting Crusade!</h1>

        <p>My name is Demo, and this is a website where I write and upload my useless garbage. You can expect Adam Sandler conspiracy theories or <b>rare cursed images</b>. ‚ñÑÔ∏ªÃ∑Ãø‚îªÃø‚ïê‚îÅ‰∏Ä</p>

        <p>In addition to these, you may also find my good friends' shitposts, as well. As an example, my boy FeedingWizard123 wrote a good Hitler fanfiction, you can find it on this website.</p>

        <h3>Multiple Personality Disorder Shitpost</h3>

        <p class="tab">"hello guys its your average weeb here ive read killing stalking backwards 4 times but only because i like the artstyle and definitely not because im into gay bdsm üò©üëå also i have changed my gender to attack on titan do not screenshot this" -<i>ANTICHRISTNUNU666</i></p>

        <p class="tab">"yeah that feeling when you just wanna read a furry boyslave manga of 2 student boys sucking each others cocks in the library but you have to give you credit card number first" -<i>buying african children</i></p>

        <p>Here we can see a classical multiple personality disorder shitpost. The creator, FeedingWizard123, a.k.a <em>ANTICHRISTNUNU666</em> and <em>buying african children</em>, certainly makes a good point here.</p>
